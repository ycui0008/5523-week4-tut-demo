Hello, Website!

For more information about simple R Markdown websites, please read the documentation at https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html.

Please also note that simple R Markdown sites are _not_ based on **blogdown**. They are probably good for websites with only a few Rmd documents. For larger-scale and more sophisticated websites (such as blogs), you may want to use **blogdown** instead: https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
```



```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins %>% 
  count(species, island) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```
```{r plot}
p <- penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
ggplotly()
```
